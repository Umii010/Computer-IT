<h2>If you answered no, please help us understand why?</h2>
Answer:
As a current BS computer science student at SZABIST University, I am facing financial constraints in paying for my course.
Given my current circumstances, taking out a loan is not feasible, as my parents have limited income and my education is already funded by a bank loan.
The additional financial burden of this course would be too much for me and my family to bear. 
Thus, receiving financial aid for this course would be a tremendous help. 
I am committed to giving back to this platform and contributing to its growth as a way of showing my gratitude for the support provided to me during this,
difficult time.
